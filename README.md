# Oh,**hello world**, time to learn git. _again_.
_wheeeeeeeeeee_

### Things that confuse me about git:
 * the difference in starting a repo on my local machine and then getting it onto Github vs. the other way around
 * branching and merging. I never did that working solo on front end projects
 * forking still seems mysterious too

 ## I know eventually git will save my ass! 

 ``` <p>Welp. this is code right?</p> ```

 Does this work like it does in Slack? 

 >why, yes. Yes it does.
